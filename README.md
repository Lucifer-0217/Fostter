# Foster DoS Attack Tool

## Description

The **Foster DoS Attack Tool** is an advanced penetration testing tool developed to simulate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. It enables security professionals to assess the resilience of their systems by safely launching controlled DoS attacks. This tool is particularly useful for identifying potential vulnerabilities under stress.

> **Disclaimer:** This tool is strictly for educational purposes and legal penetration testing. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical. The authors are not responsible for any misuse.

## Features

- **Protocol Support**: Works with HTTP, TCP, and UDP protocols.
- **Custom Payloads**: Customize payloads to target specific vulnerabilities.
- **Multi-threading**: Supports concurrent requests with customizable threads.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for analysis and documentation.
- **Rate Limiting**: Control the rate of requests to manage impact.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lucifer-0217/Foster.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure that all required Python packages are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the tool**:
   Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python foster_dos.py --target [TARGET_IP] --port [TARGET_PORT] --protocol [PROTOCOL]
   ```

## Usage

```bash
python foster_dos.py --target 192.168.1.100 --port 80 --protocol HTTP
```

### Command-Line Options:
- `--target`: IP or domain of the target system.
- `--port`: Port number to attack.
- `--protocol`: Protocol to be used (HTTP, TCP, UDP).
- `--threads`: Number of concurrent threads (default: 10).
- `--duration`: Attack duration in seconds (default: 60).
- `--payload`: Optional custom payload.

### Example:

To initiate an HTTP flood attack on `192.168.1.100` over port 80 with 50 threads for 120 seconds:

```bash
python foster_dos.py --target 192.168.1.100 --port 80 --protocol HTTP --threads 50 --duration 120
```
